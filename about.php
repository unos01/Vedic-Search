        Our major website is the Vedic Search. It is not only the first site that we have built, but even today, a large part of our collective effort is 
        spent in improving this site. We see this website as representative of all our work, and also as a model of how we think such work should be done. 
        This website only for the Bhagavad Geeta.

        The texts are in Sanskrit and can be viewed in any of 2 language scripts: Hindi and English. We hope to put up English translations very soon.

        Dynamic fonts have been used on this site, so no download of fonts is required. However, if you face problems viewing the site, first look at the 
        sections on Technical Requirements and Fonts Troubleshooting. If the problem persists, please send us email. We will appreciate any other feedback
        /comments.

        We wish you joy, and invoke the blessings of Vyasa and Sankara on your study of Vedanta!
