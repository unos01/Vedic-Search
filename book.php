        The Vedas are the religious texts which inform the religion of Hinduism (also known as 
        Sanatan Dharma meaning “Eternal Order” or “Eternal Path”). 
        The term veda means “knowledge” in that they are thought to contain the fundamental knowledge relating to the 
        underlying cause of, function of, and personal response to existence.

        They are considered among the oldest, if not the oldest, religious works in the world. 
        They are commonly referred to as “scripture”, which is accurate in that they can be defined as holy write
        concerning the nature of the Divine. Unlike the scriptures of other religions, however, the Vedas are not thought to 
        have been revealed to a certain person or persons at a specific historical moment; they are believed to have always existed 
        and were apprehended by sages in deep meditative states at some point prior to c. 
        1500 BCE but precisely when is unknown.
